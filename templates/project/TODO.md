# Project TODO

Use this checklist to finish bootstrapping the generated project. Trim or expand as needed.

- [ ] Rename references to `<PROJECT NAME>` across README, docs, and templates.
- [ ] Review each command stub under `tools/` and implement real behaviour.
- [ ] Populate `CMD_OPTIONS`, `CMD_EXAMPLES`, and `CMD_DESCRIPTION` for every command.
- [ ] Add or update TAP tests in `tests/*.t` for new logic; run `sh tests/run`.
- [ ] Configure CI to execute `sh tests/run` (and additional suites if required).
- [ ] Decide on installation/distribution strategy and document it in the README.
- [ ] Complete `docs/` with any domain-specific guides or API references.
- [ ] Decide on supported distribution channels (tarball via `make dist`, Debian via `make deb`, plus Homebrew/container as needed) and document install steps.
- [ ] Set the project license and update this checklist as tasks are completed.
