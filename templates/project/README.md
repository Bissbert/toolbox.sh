# <PROJECT NAME>

> Replace this with a concise mission statement that explains who the CLI serves and the primary workflow it automates.

## Highlights
- âš¡ Outline 3-4 headline features (e.g., "Git-style command tree", "Offline-friendly", "Integrates with â€¦").
- ðŸ§© Mention any key integrations or environments the CLI targets.
- âœ… List the top reasons a contributor or user should adopt this tool.

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites** â€” note required tools (e.g., `/bin/sh`, `curl`, APIs) and environment variables.
2. **Install / Fetch** â€” document how to install locally (`make install-user`, package managers, or `git clone`).
3. **Bootstrap** â€” show the minimal command sequence to get real output:
   ```sh
   <cli> help
   <cli> <command> [--options]
   ```

## Command Overview
Create a table summarising your commands. Example:

| Command | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | Summarise deployment health. | Consumes `<config>` from `$PROJECT_HOME`. |
| `release plan` | Generates release playbooks. | Requires `CMD_OPTIONS` flags X/Y. |

> Keep the table in sync with the autogenerated help output (`<cli> help`) so users can trust the docs.

## Configuration
- Document config file locations (default path, `TOOLBOX_CONFIG_DIR`, overrides).
- Specify environment variables and precedence rules.
- Link to any sample configs stored under `docs/` or `templates/`.

## Development Workflow
- Outline how to add new commands (`bin/<cli> new <path>`) and update metadata fields (`CMD_USAGE`, `CMD_OPTIONS`).
- Mention where to place fixtures (`tests/fixtures/`), logs, and generated artefacts.
- Encourage contributors to run `sh tests/run` (or `make test`) before submitting changes.

## Documentation & Support
- Link to additional guides in `docs/` (architecture, reference, onboarding).
- Note the preferred support channel (issues, Slack, email).
- Add release cadence or maintenance status if relevant.
